## Hi there 👋 Thanks for visiting!

[Noke Codes, Inc](https://nokecodes.github.io/)

🙋‍♀️ Visit the website if you'd like. Still under construction, but coming along nicely.

🍿 The repositories do contain some useful code examples. Feel free to browse around. 

Just keep in mind no active development has happened the past three years.

This project has stalled due to the pandemic. Hope to resume activity again in 2024/2025.
